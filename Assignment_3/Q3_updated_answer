Q: Please explain, why is the output of question 3 not 21, 22, 23?

Answer: 

	1. static int a = 20; Here static variable a is initialized with the value 20.
	
	2. static { a++; } This is a static initialization block which will increments a by 1.
	
	3. Static initialization blocks always executed only once when the class is loaded, so this block will increment a from 20 to 21.

	4. int a; { a++; System.out.println(a); }For each object creation this block will be executed before the constructor. It increments a by 1 and gives value of a.

	5. when main method is executed following things will happens:
		5.1: For each Myclass object(obj, obj2, obj3), the instance initialization block is executed

		5.2: For obj a is initially 21 (due to the static block). Then, it is incremented in the instance block and prints 22

		5.3: For obj2 a is still 22 it iss incremented in the instance block and print 23

		5.4: For obj3 a is still 23 it is incremented in the instance block and print 24

	6. So the output will be: 22 23 24 and not 21 22 23
	
	7. The static initialization block modifies the static variable only once, but instance initialization block modifies the instance variable a for each object creation.
